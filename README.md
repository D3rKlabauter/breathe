### Project Description:

My work is intended to visually overwhelm the viewer at first sight with a large number of news headlines loaded in real time. Each block consists of a heading whose letters are shown one after the other - the first letter is colored in red. When moving the mouse cursor, the selected message is replaced with a positive term whose letters change more slowly.

The rapidly changing letters present the viewer with barely legible messages whose speed causes stress. By focusing on the slowly changing text, a relaxing, meditative state is evoked â€“ letting the viewer break out of the information overload of everyday life.
